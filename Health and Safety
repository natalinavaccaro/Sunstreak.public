SunStreak – Health & Safety
Effective Date: October 5, 2025
SunStreak (“we,” “our,” or “us”) created this Health & Safety page to help users understand how to use the SunStreakmobile application (“App”) responsibly and to support healthy sun-protection practices.
This page forms part of our commitment to transparency and complements our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Health & Safety guidance.
 
1. Purpose of SunStreak
SunStreak is a wellness and habit-tracking application designed to encourage regular sunscreen use and raise UV-awareness.
SunStreak is not a medical device and does not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition.
 
2. General Sun-Safety Recommendations
To protect your skin and reduce UV-related risks, we recommend that users follow recognized public-health guidance, including:
•	Apply a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher to all exposed skin.
•	Apply sunscreen 15–30 minutes before sun exposure and re-apply at least every 2 hours, or sooner after swimming, sweating, or towel-drying.
•	Combine sunscreen with protective clothing, wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses, and shade whenever possible.
•	Try to avoid direct sun exposure during peak UV hours (10 a.m.–4 p.m.).
•	For infants under 6 months, consult a qualified health-care provider before using sunscreen; keep infants in the shade and appropriately clothed.
These tips are for general educational purposes only and do not replace professional medical guidance.
 
3. UV-Index Information
•	The UV-index readings in SunStreak come from trusted third-party data providers (such as Apple WeatherKit).
•	Actual UV exposure may vary due to factors such as altitude, reflective surfaces (water, snow), local weather, and shade.
•	Use the UV index as a helpful guide, not a guarantee of personal risk.
 
4. Skin-Health & Medical Disclaimer
•	SunStreak does not provide medical or dermatological advice.
•	If you notice new or changing moles, suspicious spots, severe rashes, blistering sunburns, or other concerning symptoms, consult a licensed dermatologist or qualified health-care provider promptly.
•	In any medical emergency—such as severe allergic reactions, heatstroke, or extensive blistering sunburn—call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately.
 
5. Special Considerations
Certain groups may be at higher risk of sun damage and should consult their health-care provider for personalized guidance:
•	People with a history of skin cancer or precancerous lesions
•	Individuals with photosensitive conditions or taking photosensitizing medications
•	Children and adolescents, whose skin may be more sensitive
•	People with light or freckled skin types who burn easily
 
6. Responsible App Use
•	SunStreak’s streak scores, UV badges, and reminders are informational tools only.
•	Always follow the product instructions on sunscreen labels and your health-care provider’s recommendations.
•	Do not rely on SunStreak as a substitute for regular skin examinations or professional medical consultations.
 
7. Data Privacy & Safety
SunStreak is committed to protecting user privacy:
•	We do not collect or store Protected Health Information (PHI).
•	Personal data we collect (e.g., streak counts, device info) is described in our Privacy Policy.
•	We employ reasonable security measures to protect stored data, but no system is completely secure.
 
8. Updates to This Page
We may update these Health & Safety guidelines as sun-protection recommendations or app features evolve.
When we do, we will update the “Effective Date” above and make the revised version available within the App and on our website.
