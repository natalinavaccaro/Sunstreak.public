Privacy Policy
Effective Date: October 5, 2025
1. Information We Collect
We strive to collect only what we need to run the App.
a. Information You Provide
•	Account details: Email address or display name (if you choose to create an account).
•	Support requests: Any information you include in emails you send us.
b. Information Collected Automatically
•	Device information: device model, operating system, app version, language, crash logs.
•	App-usage data: streak counts, days you logged sunscreen use, UV-index trends.
•	Location data: Not collected for tracking. The App only requests your location at the moment you ask to see local UV index and does not store it on our servers.
c. No Sensitive Health or Payment Data
•	We do not collect credit-card data, government IDs, or protected medical records (PHI).
•	SunStreak is a wellness-tracking tool and does not diagnose or treat conditions.
 
2. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:
•	Provide core App features (e.g., calculating your sunscreen streak, showing UV index).
•	Improve functionality, debug crashes, and measure engagement.
•	Respond to your support questions.
•	Comply with legal obligations.
 
3. How We Share Your Information
We do not sell your personal data.
We may share limited data:
•	Service providers: (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics, email delivery) solely to operate the App.
•	Legal compliance: if required by law, regulation, or valid legal request.
•	Business transfer: if we undergo a merger or acquisition, users will be notified.
 
4. Third-Party Services
•	UV-index data is provided by Apple WeatherKit (or other weather APIs).
Those services may receive standard device and request information when you fetch UV index.
•	Our App may link to third-party websites or services; their privacy policies govern their practices.
 
5. Data Retention
•	Account and usage data are retained as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services.
•	You may request deletion at any time (see Your Choices below).
•	Crash and analytics data are retained in aggregated or anonymized form.
 
6. Your Choices & Rights
•	Access / deletion: You can request a copy or deletion of your personal data by emailing sunstreakapp@gmail.com
•	Opt-out of analytics: In-app settings (if available) let you limit certain analytics collection.
•	Location: You can disable location permissions in your device settings at any time.
•	Marketing: We do not currently send marketing emails; if we ever do, you’ll be able to opt out.
Residents of certain regions (e.g., EU/EEA, UK, California) may have additional statutory privacy rights. We will honor those as required by law.
 
7. Children’s Privacy
SunStreak is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction).
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
If you believe a child provided data without parental consent, please contact us so we can delete it.
 
8. Security
We use industry-standard technical and organizational safeguards (such as HTTPS, limited access controls) to protect your information.
However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
 
9. International Users
Our servers are currently located in [United States / hosting region].
By using the App, you consent to the transfer of your data to that location, which may have different data-protection laws than your home country.
 
10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Policy occasionally.
When we do, we’ll revise the “Effective Date” above and post the new version within the App and at our public link.
Significant changes will be highlighted or communicated by reasonable means.
